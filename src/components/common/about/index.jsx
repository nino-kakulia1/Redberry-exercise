        As we said, Redberry has been on the field for quite some time now, and
        we have touched and embraced a variety of programming languages,
        technologies, philosophies, and frameworks. We are battle-tested in PHP
        Laravel Stack with Vue.js, refined in React, and allies with Serverside
        technologies like Docker and Kubernetes, and now we have set foot in the
        web3 industry.
